<h2>Position: Senior Programmer Analyst<br>
Dates: April 1989 to June 2020</h2>

<h1>Skill Highlights</h1>
<ul>
<li>Proficiency in Oracle database and PL/SQL in Toad for Oracle to setup Development and Test environments for data warehousing application so that IT and testers after the environment is refreshed from Production.</li>
<li>Detailed maintenance and monitoring of Autosys scheduled jobs that pull data from other systems for input into a supplier quality data warehouse application.</li>
<li>Very established in building Perl and Korn Shell scripts (on AIX and Windows). I worked Perl in the ETL component of data warehousing and application health reports; data migration (including sync and fixing errors) from a legacy DB2-based application to Dassault Systems ENOVIA product data manager.</li>
<li>Advanced proficiency in using SQL for DB2 in SPUFI, QMF on MVS, AIX db2 command line and Perl. Progressive thinking of relational database concepts gained from years of working with IBM's DB2. Add SQL processing capability to development environment builds for FORTRAN, Java (SQLJ), C and C++.</li>
<li>Performed system design, coding and implementation of a UNIX-based utility data migration application that allowed the real-time reading and writing of CATIA V4 CAD models into ENOVIA. The ENOVIA code, or server side, was configured as a UNIX daemon which required coordination with the systems management group.</li>
<li>Designed and developed J2EE applications for IBM's WebSphere server, including deploying applications with the Administrative Console and TCL script. Also developed a build script for developers to use that processed SQLJ (static SQL in Java).</li>
<li>Y2K development/testing, creating J2EE user interface on IBM WebSphere, porting DB2 from MVS (aka, OS/390 and zOS) to AIX.</li>
<li>Porting application from MVS to AIX with conversion of PL/I to C, FORTRAN, created Perl build utilities to handle imbedded SQL in C and Fortran for DB2.</li>
<li>IMS application testing; CATIA V3 GII user interface programming with Fortran on MVS.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Skill Categories</h1>

<h2>DATABASES</h2>
<p class="shifted">
During my 31 years at Boeing, my IT experience has been heavily into databases. I worked mostly on IBM DB2 on the mainframe (OS/390 or zOS) and later on IBM AIX. The database work was to support the configuration information about Dassault Systemes’ CATIA CAD/CAM models first used for the 777.
</p>
<p class="shifted">
Second to DB2 was my work with Oracle on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). I worked on applications where the database stored information about supplier quality as well as the configuration management of Boeing applications and engineering workstations. I’ve become rather proficient at writing stored procedures in Oracle that use the PL/SQL database programming language. I worked with setting up scripts and makefiles to have Fortran use imbedded SQL instead of calling to another language. I worked with porting Fortran SQL routines to AIX.
</p>
<h2>DATA MIGRATION</h2>

<p class="shifted">
I wrote scripts to automate the migration of many thousands to CATIA CAD/CAM models into the ENOVIA product management system before the retirement of the legacy application and shift from CATIA V4 on AIX to CATIA V5 on Microsoft Windows. Metadata from the legacy database was used in the migration and entered into ENOVIA.
</p>

<h2>SCRIPTING LANGUAGES</h2>

<p class="shifted">
Another significant area of my IT experience has been with scripting languages used to automate builds for developers. I worked on automation in mainframe JCL procedures, CLISTs and Rexx. Automation work continued on UNIX (AIX) with Korn Shell, Perl and makefiles. I also assisted with the conversion of legacy PL/I code into C.
</p>

<h2>SYSTEM ADMIN/CONFIG</h2>

<p class="shifted">
I also assisted a work group that I used to be in with configuring RHEL servers (VMs actually). I worked with the root account to install Perl, Oracle client software and so on and then copied over the application software from AIX where I worked on re-configuring it to work on RHEL. Years before Boeing paid for me to go out of state for training on AIX system administration but I haven’t really used that skill.
</p>

<h2>WEB PROGRAMMING</h2>

<p class="shifted">
I spent several years working on IBM WebSphere under the J2EE framework which uses Java in servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP). I worked under popular Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. This application presented information from the system that contains CATIA V4 metadata. I continued my developer support/automation by compiling SQL imbedded in Java or SQLJ.
